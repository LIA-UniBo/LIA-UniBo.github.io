However, this kind of approach requires to solve multiple challanges that are suited for several theses and projects, e.g.: making sure that the models used in EML (chiefly NNs and DTs) received significant updates from each solution, handling exploration\/exploitation trade-offs, evaluating confidence intervals...

DER combines both reliable (deterministic) power systems with uncontrollable (stochastic) Renewable Energy Sources (RES). An Energy Management System generally allocates the power flows from the different sources minimizing the cost and satisfying the user demand. To be efficient at run-time, a simply greedy heuristic is generally used in this application scenario to find online the optimal operational decisions. Since both the RES and the user demand are stochastic, hybrid offline\/online methods have shown to be effective in this scenario. By exploting the offline information (e.g. probability distribution, or historical data), an offline parameter tuning phase can applied to the greedy heuristic based on optimality conditions. There are several methods to improve the offline (tuning) phase: a recent work introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm in the tuning phase. Results show that DRL can be effectively adopted as a black-box optimization algorithm. From the RL side, the online heuristic can prevent the agent to choose infeasible actions. In this project, the candidate has to compare the method mentioned above with a state-of-the-art approach called \"Safety Layer\": if infeasible, the original action is replaced with the closest feasible one such that the Euclidean norm is minimized.",
